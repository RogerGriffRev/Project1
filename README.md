# Wikipedia Analytics Project
This project tested our ability to use MapReduce code in Scala, as well as run queries in Hive.

We used Wikipedia statistics dumps that are publicly available to answer 5 predefined questions and 1 custom question.
These dumps can be found at: https://dumps.wikimedia.org/other/analytics/

With that data accessible we could MapReduce and analyze the data to answer the following questions.
1. Which English wikipedia article got the most traffic on October 20?
2. What English wikipedia article has the largest fraction of its readers follow an internal link to another wikipedia article?
3. What series of wikipedia articles, starting with [Hotel California](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hotel_California), keeps the largest fraction of its readers clicking on internal links?  This is similar to (2), but you should continue the analysis past the first article.
4. Find an example of an English wikipedia article that is relatively more popular in the UK.  Find the same for the US and Australia.
5. Analyze how many users will see the average vandalized wikipedia page before the offending edit is reversed.
6.Find pages that users view on the English, Spanish and German wikipedias and show the percentage of views each site gave. 

Finally, make a powerpoint to present the findings.
